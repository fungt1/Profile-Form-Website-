IMPORTANT NOTE: so the php was only used for testing purposes on my end on how to handle http requests between html forms with a sql database. The actual scripting language we are using for the real project will be in python so for future use of my own personal project php can be option to use. I provided seperate html files which are located in the profile folder.This portion will be away from php for project use on the backend of python. The python html css part can be found on Shafin's github.

This is a profile form for a senior project I am working on with a group. This form will handle all the information a user will input and send it to a database where it can process within a mobile appliation that communicates with the Google Glass facial recognition. NOTE: This was created from my localhost so if you wanted to try it yourself you are going to need to put it on your own localhost in your computer. All my personal locahost information were taken out from the code as well.
