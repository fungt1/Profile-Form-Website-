PURPOSE: Handling https request from a database and html form. Front-end and back-end coding combinded. 

This is a profile form. It will handle all the information a user will input and send it to a database where it can be processed. Contains a landing page, login page, register page, profile and view info page. NOTE: This was created from my localhost so if you wanted to try it yourself you are going to need to put it on your own localhost in your computer. All my personal locahost information was taken out from the code as well. You can see screenshots of the website on the folder section labled "pictues of my website."
